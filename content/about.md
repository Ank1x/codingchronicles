Hi, I am Ank1x and welcome to my blog. I'm a newbie web developer who is currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My ultimate goal is to become a full stack developer and create fast, responsive websites that people will love to use. 

When I'm not coding, I love to indulge my love of mangoes, which are one of my favorite fruits. I also enjoy listening to piano instrumentals and movie soundtracks, which I find both relaxing and inspiring.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you find my experiences useful and informative.
